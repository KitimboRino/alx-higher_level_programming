0x00. Python - Hello, World

Why Python programming is awesome:

Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it easy to learn and write code quickly.
It has a large and active community, providing extensive libraries and frameworks.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Who created Python:

Python was created by Guido van Rossum.
Who is Guido van Rossum:

Guido van Rossum is a Dutch programmer and the creator of the Python programming language. He released the first version of Python in 1991.
Where does the name ‘Python’ come from:

The name "Python" was inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, of which Guido van Rossum was a fan.
What is the Zen of Python:

The Zen of Python is a collection of guiding principles for writing computer programs in the Python language. It can be accessed by typing import this in the Python interpreter.
How to use the Python interpreter:

Open a terminal or command prompt and type python to enter the Python interpreter.
You can execute Python commands directly in the interpreter.
How to print text and variables using print:

Use the print() function to display text or the value of variables.
Example: print("Hello, World!") or x = 5; print(x).
How to use strings:

Strings can be declared using single or double quotes (' or ").
Example: my_string = "Hello, Python!"
What are indexing and slicing in Python:

Indexing: Accessing individual elements of a sequence (e.g., string, list) using their position.
Example: my_string[0] returns the first character of my_string.
Slicing: Extracting a portion of a sequence.
Example: my_string[1:5] returns a substring from index 1 to 4 of my_string.
What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle:

The official Python coding style is outlined in PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8).
To check your code against PEP 8, you can use tools like pycodestyle (formerly known as pep8).
Install pycodestyle using pip install pycodestyle, and then run it on your code files or directories.
