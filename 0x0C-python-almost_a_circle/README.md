0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

**Unit Testing:**
Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation to ensure that they function as expected. The purpose of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. In Python, the `unittest` module provides a framework for writing and running unit tests.

To implement unit testing in a large project:

1. **Organize Your Code:** Structure your code in a way that promotes modularity and separation of concerns, making it easier to test individual units.

2. **Write Test Cases:** Create test cases for each unit of code. Test cases should cover both normal and edge cases to ensure thorough testing.

3. **Use Test Frameworks:** Utilize test frameworks like `unittest`, `pytest`, or `nose` to manage and run your tests efficiently.

4. **Automate Testing:** Set up a continuous integration (CI) system to automatically run your tests whenever code changes are made.

5. **Mock Dependencies:** When testing a unit, mock or stub external dependencies to isolate the unit and test it independently.

**Serialization and Deserialization:**
Serialization is the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted. Deserialization is the reverse process, converting the serialized data back into its original form.

In Python, you can use the `pickle` module for basic serialization and deserialization of objects. For more human-readable formats like JSON, you can use the `json` module.

Example using JSON:

```
import json

# Serialization
data = {"key": "value"}
serialized_data = json.dumps(data)

# Deserialization
deserialized_data = json.loads(serialized_data)
```

**Write and Read a JSON File:**
```
import json

# Write to JSON file
data = {"key": "value"}
with open("example.json", "w") as json_file:
    json.dump(data, json_file)

# Read from JSON file
with open("example.json", "r") as json_file:
    loaded_data = json.load(json_file)
```

**`*args` and `**kwargs`:**
`*args` and `**kwargs` allow a function to accept a variable number of arguments.

- `*args` is used to pass a variable number of non-keyword (positional) arguments to a function.

  ```
  def example_function(*args):
      for arg in args:
          print(arg)

  example_function(1, 2, 3)
  ```

- `**kwargs` is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function.

  ```
  def example_function(**kwargs):
      for key, value in kwargs.items():
          print(f"{key}: {value}")

  example_function(name="John", age=25)
  ```

**Handling Named Arguments in a Function:**
Named arguments in a function allow you to pass arguments using the parameter names. Example:

```
def example_function(name, age):
    print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")

# Calling the function with named arguments
example_function(name="John", age=25)
```

Named arguments make the code more readable, and the order of arguments does not matter when calling the function.
